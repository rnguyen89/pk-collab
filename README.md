# pk-collab

The name is suppose to reference 'Parents and Kids' and is a full stack web app that lets parents use a trello-like board
with their children. 

The app is deployed through Heroku: https://cryptic-river-66724.herokuapp.com/

# Introduction

This app was inpired by trello and Google Keep. I like the look of sticky notes and thought, if an web app could look simple
enough for children, they may actually use it. It is suppose to be an easy way for parents to create cards for their
children and fill it with a task. Each card has title/description/points, and there is a reward modal for parents to update.
The top has a progress bar and total points that users could see when logged in.
